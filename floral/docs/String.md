#  String
# WARNING: SPECIFICATION CHANGED

The Floral structure representing strings of characters is encapsulated by `String`. Similarly to `Array` it provides a random-access mutable interface for contiguous characters.

Later in this document the bridged C API will be discussed.

`String` is 24-bytes, composed of three 8-byte unsigned integers.

```
// Essential components of String
struct String {
    String(): length = 0, capacity = 4 {
        this.start = alloc(Char, 4);
    }
    ~String() {
        dealloc(this.start);
    }
private:
    var start: &Char;
exposed get:
    var length: UInt;
    var capacity: UInt
};
```

You can convert a `String` to a c-string with the `cstr(): &Char` method. This method allocates and thus must be freed by the caller. It returns a null-terminated c-string with the copied contents of the original string.

#### Member functions

**Concatenation**

```
var a = "Hello, ";
a.cat("world!");
```

Use the `cat` member function to perform concatenation with another string.

**Appending**
```
var str = "ab";
str.push('c');
```

Use the `push` member function to append a character to the end of the string.

**Insertion**

```
var carroll = "'Tut, tut, child!'  'Everythingâ€™s got a moral, if only you can find it.'";
carroll.insert("said the Duchess.", 19);
```

All these functions will reallocate the `String` by a growth factor of 1.5 (close to the golden ratio for reusing memory).

**Removal**

```
var verne = "If there were no thunder, men would oh this shouldn't be here have little fear of lightning.1";
verne.remove(37, 62); // "oh this shouldn't be here"
verne.pop(); // '1'
```

There are two main removal functions: one deletes a whole segment specified by an upper and lower bound, while the other pops off the last character. Neither deallocates any memory. A specific call to `compact` can do so.

**Copying**

```
let str = "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery";
let str2 = str.copy();
```

This function returns a new string with the same contents, length and capacity.

**Extracting C String**
```
let floral = "This is quite the example"; // type = struct String
let c = floral.cstr(); // type = &Char
```

If the `String` was initialized with a C string and not modified, this returns that same C string. Otherwise, a new string is allocated, appending a null terminator of necessary.

**Random-Access**

```
let wonder = "World keep on turnin'\nCause it won't be too long";
let first = wonder.front(); // type = Char
let last = wonder.end(); // type = Char
let singleQuote = wonder.at(20); // type = Char
let slice = wonder.slice(6, 20); // type = StringView
```

#### C API

With the `using C;` directive (or the `--use-C` compiler flag) you have access to various bridged C functions. These include some string functions. If you wish to perform low-level string interactions, you can use these.

They include:
```
strcpy(dest: &Char, src: &Char): &Char;
strncpy(dest: &Char, src: &Char, n: UInt): &Char;

strcmp(s1: &Char, s2: &Char): Int32;
strncmp(s1: &Char, s2: &Char, n: UInt): Int32;

strdup(s: &Char): &Char;
strndup(string: &Char, n: UInt): &Char;
```
...and many more.

These functions perform as you would expect them to in C.

You can initialize `String`s with C strings. This will simply calculate length and store the pointer. The capacity will be zero. If the string is modified, then the c string is copied.
