#  Tutorial 0.1: Using floralc

The Floral compiler is invoked through commands. For a complete specification view `docs/The Floral Compiler.md`.

The general format for invoking the floral compiler is:

```
$ floralc -o executable_name input_file.floral
```

The ordering does not matter as long as you put the `-o` before the target's name.
